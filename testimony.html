    <h2>My Testimony</h2>
    <p>
      My journey has not been easy. I struggled through many challenges and faced confusion from leaders who claimed to follow Jesus but whose actions did not reflect His truth. Their words often left me lost and uncertain about my faith. Yet, through all the noise and disappointment, I held tightly to God’s Word, the King James Bible which became my firm foundation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the midst of this struggle that I truly learned to rely on Jesus alone, not on imperfect people. God’s grace carried me through those dark seasons and led me to a deeper, more personal relationship with Him. Today, I stand strong in faith, knowing that my walk is directed by the true Shepherd, not man’s opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      This testimony is my witness that no matter the confusion or hardship, God’s light will always lead us home.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are located in Lafayette, Indiana, I invite you on this journey as well to see even if you are blind, and walk even if your limbs don’t work properly. Welcome, to Walk By Faith.
    </p>

    <div class="scripture">
      <p>“Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.”<br />— Psalm 119:105 (KJV)</p>
    </div>

    <h2>What Makes a Christian a Christian?</h2>
    <p>
      In Scripture, Jesus says, "If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me." (Luke 9:23, KJV). To be a Christian is not simply to believe, but to truly follow. True conversion means turning away from the old ways of the flesh and becoming something completely new—something only God can create.
    </p>
    <div class="scripture">“Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.”<br />— 2 Corinthians 5:17 (KJV)</div>

    <p>
      This process won’t be easy, and it shouldn’t be. Our pure, loving Savior and King died for us, not because He sinned, but because we did. He bore our punishment so we could walk in freedom. That sacrifice is a model for us: to love Him completely, even blindly, knowing He will never fail to guide us.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, when the Lord answers your prayers, don’t freeze. Step forward into repentance, transformation, joy, and peace. True peace is knowing that in the end times, no harm will come to you. Just as Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego walked through the fiery furnace without being burned, you too will be protected.
    </p>
    <div class="scripture">“Our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace... But if not, be it known... that we will not serve thy gods.”<br />— Daniel 3:17-18 (KJV)</div>

    <p>
      Jesus isn’t asking for much. Hearing, seeing, and receiving are the first steps. When He gives you the chance to reflect, and you see your old ways clearly, repent. Don’t kneel once—kneel every time He gives you the grace to wake up and breathe.
    </p>
    <div class="scripture">“The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.”<br />— Psalm 34:18 (KJV)</div>

    <p>
      Submit. Seek Him, and you will find Him. "Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you." (James 4:8). Just like a marriage needs time, effort, and commitment, so does your relationship with God. If you don’t spend time with your spouse, the bond weakens—and so it is with God. Don’t let the enemy divorce you from your first love.
    </p>
    <div class="scripture">“Nevertheless, I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.”<br />— Revelation 2:4 (KJV)</div>

    <p>
      This world will try to captivate your mind, but God doesn’t manipulate. He loves. He formed you in the womb, breathed air into your lungs, and called you His.
    </p>
    <div class="scripture">“I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.”<br />— Psalm 139:14 (KJV)</div>

    <p>
      Yes, people will fail—your parents, your partner, your friends. But He is your Father, your Healer, and your Redeemer. Love your neighbor, but do not idolize them.
    </p>
    <div class="scripture">“Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.”<br />— Psalm 146:3 (KJV)</div>

    <p>
      It’s a hard truth. At first, you may run from it. It’s scary to trust someone you cannot see—but let me challenge you. Look around. Creation itself is His gift and confirmation.
    </p>
    <div class="scripture">“For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen... so that they are without excuse.”<br />— Romans 1:20 (KJV)</div>

    <p>
      To be a Christian is to accept that God is real, that Jesus died and rose again, and that He fights for you in unseen realms. He is not like man. He is holy, righteous, and loving. What once drained you will be replaced by joy and peace. Trust Him.
    </p>
    <div class="scripture">“Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.”<br />— Proverbs 3:5 (KJV)</div>

    <p>
      Call on Jesus’s name today. Let Him be your Savior, your King, your peace. What’s your testimony?
    </p>
