    <h2>My Testimony</h2>
    <p>
      My journey has not been easy. I struggled through many challenges and faced confusion from leaders who claimed to follow Jesus but whose actions did not reflect His truth. Their words often left me lost and uncertain about my faith. Yet, through all the noise and disappointment, I held tightly to God’s Word, the King James Bible which became my firm foundation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the midst of this struggle that I truly learned to rely on Jesus alone, not on imperfect people. God’s grace carried me through those dark seasons and led me to a deeper, more personal relationship with Him. Today, I stand strong in faith, knowing that my walk is directed by the true Shepherd, not man’s opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      This testimony is my witness that no matter the confusion or hardship, God’s light will always lead us home.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are located in Lafayette, Indiana, I invite you on this journey as well to see even if you are blind, and walk even if your limbs don’t work properly. Welcome, to Walk By Faith.
