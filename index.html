        Islam is a monotheistic religion founded on the revelations given to the Prophet Muhammad. Muslims believe in one God, Allah, and follow the Quran as their holy text. The Five Pillars of Islam—faith, prayer, charity, fasting, and pilgrimage—form the foundation of Islamic life. Daily prayers are a vital practice, performed facing Mecca. Charity and kindness to others are highly emphasized. Ramadan, a month of fasting, is a time of reflection and devotion. The religion promotes justice, humility, and respect. Islam has a rich cultural and historical legacy across the world.

        Buddhism was founded by Siddhartha Gautama, known as the Buddha, over 2,500 years ago. It teaches the Four Noble Truths, which outline the nature of suffering and the path to liberation. The Eightfold Path guides followers in ethical living, mindfulness, and wisdom. Buddhists seek to reach enlightenment, or Nirvana, by overcoming desire and attachment. Meditation is a core practice. Compassion, non-violence, and self-awareness are central values. There are different schools of Buddhism, including Theravāda, Mahāyāna, and Vajrayāna. The religion has spread throughout Asia and the world as a philosophy of peace and self-realization.
